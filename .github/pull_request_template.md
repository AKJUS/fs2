Thanks for opening a PR!

Target the `main` branch if this PR is targeted for the 3.x series and the `series/2.5.x` branch if targeted for the 2.5.x series.

If the CI build fails due to Scalafmt, run `sbt fmt` and push the changes (generally a good idea to run this prior to opening the PR).

Feel free to ask questions on the fs2 and fs2-dev channels on the [Typelevel Discord server](https://discord.gg/9V8FZTVZ9R).
