Thanks for opening a PR!

If the CI build fails due to Scalafmt, run `sbt scalafmtAll` and push the changes (generally a good idea to run this prior to opening the PR).

It's also helpful to run `sbt prePR`, which runs tests, generates docs, and performs various checks.

Feel free to ask questions on the fs2 and fs2-dev channels on the [Typelevel Discord server](https://discord.gg/9V8FZTVZ9R).
