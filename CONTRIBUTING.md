# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project, you can find some helpful information here.

## How can I help?

Thanks for taking interest in helping us develop FS2!

We welcome all kinds of contribution, including but not limited to:

- ðŸ“– documentation improvements, explanatory images/diagrams, fixes in typos, useful links
- ðŸ§¹ refactorings of messy code, build structure, increasing test coverage or quality
- ðŸš€ new features and bugfixes (including [bug reports and feature requests][fs2-issues]).

Writing documentation is valuable for learning, so if you find some explanation insufficient, overly complicated or incorrect, it's a perfect opportunity to make a change to it!

If at any point you run into problems, you can always ask a question on [the fs2-dev channel on the Typelevel Discord][fs2-dev].

## How to submit a change

If you see something worth adding, make the relevant changes in a fork of the source code and [submit a pull request to the project][fs2-pulls]. If you don't know what you could help with, take a look at [the issues marked as "help wanted"][low-hanging-fruit] or ask on [Discord][fs2-dev].

We follow similar rules to [the cats-effect project's](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect#development).
Most importantly, any contributions are expected to be made in the form of [GitHub pull requests to the FS2 repository][fs2-pulls].
Usually it takes two approvals for a change to be merged. If it takes too long to get it approved, feel free to ask on [Discord][fs2-dev].

Remember to follow the [code of conduct][coc] in online and offline discourse.

## Building the project locally

### Prerequisites

You'll need JDK 17+, [sbt][sbt], [Node.js][node] (for running Scala.js tests), various native libraries (for running Scala Native tests).

The native libraries required are `s2n` and `openssl`. To install them on a machine with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run the following:

```bash
$ brew install s2n openssl
```

Similarly, Node.js can be installed via:

```bash
$ brew install node
```

We use several sbt plugins to build and check the project, including [MiMa (Migration Manager)][mima] and [scalafmt][scalafmt]. The [sbt-typelevel](https://typelevel.org/sbt-typelevel/) project does the bulk of the SBT configuration.

### Build process

To compile the code for the whole repository, you can start an interactive sbt shell:

```bash
$ sbt
[info] welcome to sbt 1.8.2 (Eclipse Adoptium Java 17.0.1)
[info] loading settings for project fs2-build-build-build from metals.sbt ...
[info] loading project definition from /Users/contributor/Development/oss/fs2/project/project/project

[info] loading settings for project root from build.sbt ...

[info] set scmInfo to https://github.com/typelevel/fs2
[info] set current project to root (in build file:/Users/contributor/Development/oss/fs2/)
[info] sbt server started at local:///Users/contributor/.sbt/1.0/server/6f1f885b851d15ea85bf/sock
[info] started sbt server
sbt:root>
```

Inside the shell, you can compile the sources for the currently selected Scala version using the `compile` command.
To compile the code for all Scala versions enabled in the build, use `+compile`. To include tests, `Test/compile` or `+Test/compile`, accordingly.


### Testing

To test the code, you can run the `test` command in sbt.
If you want the tests on a single platform, you can use `rootJVM/test`, `rootJS/test`, or `rootNative/test` instead.

It is possible to run a single test suite from a project on a single platform by [executing a more specific task](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing.html#testOnly), like `coreJVM/testOnly fs2.PullSpec`.

You can list all available projects by executing the `projects` task:

```sbt
sbt:root> projects
[info] In file:/Users/contributor/Development/oss/fs2/
[info] 	   benchmark
[info] 	   coreJS
[info] 	   coreJVM
[info] 	   coreNative
[info] 	   ioJS
[info] 	   ioJVM
[info] 	   ioNative
[info] 	   microsite
[info] 	   protocolsJS
[info] 	   protocolsJVM
[info] 	   protocolsNative
[info] 	   reactiveStreams
[info] 	 * root
[info] 	   rootJS
[info] 	   rootJVM
[info] 	   rootNative
[info] 	   scodecJS
[info] 	   scodecJVM
[info] 	   scodecNative
[info] 	   unidocs
```

Before submitting a change for review, it's worth running some extra checks that will be triggered in Continuous Integration:

```sbt
sbt:root> prePR
```

That will check the formatting, run all tests on the supported platforms, report any binary compatibility issues (as detected by [MiMa][mima]) and build the site.

If you run into any problems with tests, binary compatibility or other issues, feel free to ask questions on [Discord][fs2-dev].
