# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a potential security vulnerability, email details to mpilquist@gmail.com. Upon confirmation of the vulnerability, we'll use the [Github coordinated disclosure process](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities) to collaborate and publish an advisory.
